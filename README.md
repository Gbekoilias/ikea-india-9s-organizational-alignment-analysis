## 🧠 Findings — The 9S Analysis

| Dimension | Misalignment Summary |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Strategy** | European product formats and store models failed to localize to Indian consumer and spatial realities. |
| **Structure** | Dual reporting blurred accountability, slowing decision-making and execution. |
| **Systems** | Fragmented inventory and planning systems delayed product launches. |
| **Style (Leadership)** | Top-down EU-centric leadership ignored local realities. |
| **Staff** | High turnover (24.7%) due to unclear roles and KPI pressure. |
| **Skills** | Weak localization and QA expertise; delayed training. |
| **Shared Values** | Global culture didn’t translate well to Indian hierarchy norms. |
| **Sustainability** | Immature supplier base led to 8.2% QA rejection rate. |
| **Speed / Scalability** | Store rollout delays >12 months; slow approval chains. |

📉 *Each misalignment reinforces others, creating a cascading alignment failure.*

## 🌍 Key Insights

- **Adaptation beats replication:** IKEA India’s biggest failure was treating localization as translation, not transformation.  
- **Speed is a capability, not a result:** Every day lost to dual reporting reduces market traction.  
- **Sustainability starts with supplier maturity:** Resilience isn’t environmental alone — it’s operational too.
